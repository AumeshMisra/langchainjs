## Overview

We'll go over an example of how to design and implement an LLM-powered chatbot. 
This chatbot will be able to have a conversation and remember previous interactions.


Note that this chatbot that we build will only use the language model to have a conversation.
There are several other related concepts that you may be looking for:

- [Conversational RAG](/docs/tutorials/qa_chat_history): Enable a chatbot experience over an external source of data
- [Agents](/docs/tutorials/agents): Build a chatbot that can take actions

This tutorial will cover the basics which will be helpful for those two more advanced topics, but feel free to skip directly to there should you choose.


## Concepts

Here are a few of the high-level components we'll be working with:

- [`Chat Models`](/docs/concepts/#chat-models). The chatbot interface is based around messages rather than raw text, and therefore is best suited to Chat Models rather than text LLMs.
- [`Prompt Templates`](/docs/concepts/#prompt-templates), which simplify the process of assembling prompts that combine default messages, user input, chat history, and (optionally) additional retrieved context.
- [`Chat History`](/docs/concepts/#chat-history), which allows a chatbot to "remember" past interactions and take them into account when responding to followup questions. 
- Debugging and tracing your application using [LangSmith](/docs/concepts/#langsmith)

We'll cover how to fit the above components together to create a powerful conversational chatbot.

## Setup

### Installation

To install LangChain run:

import Npm2Yarn from '@theme/Npm2Yarn';

<Npm2Yarn>
  langchain @langchain/core
</Npm2Yarn>

For more details, see our [Installation guide](/docs/installation).

### LangSmith

Many of the applications you build with LangChain will contain multiple steps with multiple invocations of LLM calls.
As these applications get more and more complex, it becomes crucial to be able to inspect what exactly is going on inside your chain or agent.
The best way to do this is with [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com).

After you sign up at the link above, make sure to set your environment variables to start logging traces:

```shell
export LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2="true"
export LANGCHAIN_API_KEY="..."
```

## Quickstart

First up, let's learn how to use a language model by itself. LangChain supports many different language models that you can use interchangeably - select the one you want to use below!

import ChatModelTabs from "@theme/ChatModelTabs";

<ChatModelTabs />

```typescript

```

Let's first use the model directly. `ChatModel`s are instances of LangChain "Runnables", which means they expose a standard interface for interacting with them.
To just simply call the model, we can pass in a list of messages to the `.invoke` method.

```typescript
import { HumanMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

await model.invoke([new HumanMessage("Hi! I'm Bob")])
```

```
AIMessage {
  content: "Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?",
  additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined },
  response_metadata: {
    tokenUsage: { completionTokens: 10, promptTokens: 12, totalTokens: 22 },
    finish_reason: "stop"
  },
}
```

The model on its own does not have any concept of state. For example, if you ask a followup question:

```typescript
await model.invoke([new HumanMessage("What's my name?")])
```

```
AIMessage {
  content: "I'm sorry, I do not have access to personal information such as your name. How can I assist you today?",
  additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined },
  response_metadata: {
    tokenUsage: { completionTokens: 24, promptTokens: 12, totalTokens: 36 },
    finish_reason: "stop"
  },
}
```

Let's take a look at the example [LangSmith trace](https://smith.langchain.com/public/5befba9f-5782-466c-864c-64cc307440cd/r)

We can see that it doesn't take the previous conversation turn into context, and cannot answer the question.
This makes for a terrible chatbot experience!

To get around this, we need to pass the entire conversation history into the model. Let's see what happens when we do that:

```typescript
import { AIMessage } from "@langchain/core/messages";

await model.invoke(
    [
        new HumanMessage("Hi! I'm Bob"),
        new AIMessage("Hello Bob! How can I assist you today?"),
        new HumanMessage("What's my name?"),
    ]
)
```

```
AIMessage {
  content: "Your name is Bob.",
  additional_kwargs: { function_call: undefined, tool_calls: undefined },
  response_metadata: {
    tokenUsage: { completionTokens: 5, promptTokens: 35, totalTokens: 40 },
    finish_reason: "stop"
  },
}
```

And now we can see that we get a good response!

This is the basic idea underpinning a chatbot's ability to interact conversationally.
So how do we best implement this?

## Message History

We can use a Message History class to wrap our model and make it stateful.
This will keep track of inputs and outputs of the model, and store them in some datastore.
Future interactions will then load those messages and pass them into the chain as part of the input.
Let's see how to use this!

First, let's make sure to install `@langchain/community`, as we will be using an integration in there to store message history.

<Npm2Yarn>
  @langchain/community
</Npm2Yarn>

After that, we can import the relevant classes and set up our chain which wraps the model and adds in this message history. A key part here is the function we pass into as the `getSessionHistory`. This function is expected to take in a `sessionId` and return a Message History object. This `sessionId` is used to distinguish between separate conversations, and should be passed in as part of the config when calling the new chain (we'll show how to do that).

We also define a prompt which has two crucial fields:

1. `new MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history")` - This is a placeholder that will be replaced with the chat history when the model is called.
2. `["human", "{input}"]` - This is a standard varibale placeholder which will be replaced with any user input.

We then specify the `inputMessagesKey` and `historyMessagesKey` in the `RunnableWithMessageHistory` constructor. This tells the class where to insert the message history, and current input.

```typescript
import { ChatMessageHistory } from "@langchain/community/stores/message/in_memory";
import { BaseChatMessageHistory } from "@langchain/core/chat_history";
import { ChatPromptTemplate, MessagesPlaceholder } from "@langchain/core/prompts";
import { RunnableWithMessageHistory } from "@langchain/core/runnables";

const store: Record<string, BaseChatMessageHistory> = {};

function getMessageHistory(sessionId: string): BaseChatMessageHistory {
    if (!(sessionId in store)) {
        store[sessionId] = new ChatMessageHistory();
    }
    return store[sessionId];
}

const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
    ["system", "You are a helpful assistant."],
    new MessagesPlaceholder("chat_history"),
    ["human", "{input}"]
])

const runnable = prompt.pipe(model);

const withMessageHistory = new RunnableWithMessageHistory({
    runnable,
    getMessageHistory,
    inputMessagesKey: "input",
    historyMessagesKey: "chat_history",
})
```

We now need to create a `config` that we pass into the runnable every time.
This config contains information that is not part of the input directly, but is still useful.
In this case, we want to include a `sessionId`. This should look like:

```typescript
const config = { configurable: { sessionId: "abc123" }}

const response = await withMessageHistory.invoke(
    {
        input: "Hi! I'm Bob",
    },
    config,
)

console.log(response.content)
```

```
"I'm sorry, but I don't have access to your personal information, including your name. How can I assi"... 13 more characters
```

However, we can always go back to the original conversation (since we are persisting it in a database)

```typescript
const config = { configurable: { sessionId: "abc123" }}

const response = await withMessageHistory.invoke(
    {
        input: "What's my name?"
    },
    config,
)

console.log(response.content)
```

```
"Your name is Bob."
```

This is how we can support a chatbot having conversations with many users!

Right now, all we've done is add a simple persistence layer around the model. Let's now make our prompt a little bit more complicated. Let's assume that the prompt template now looks something like this:

```typescript
const prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.fromMessages([
    ["system", "You are a helpful assistant. Answer all questions to the best of your ability in {language}."],
    new MessagesPlaceholder("messages"),
])

const chain = prompt.pipe(model)
```

Note that we have added a new `language` input to the prompt. We can now invoke the chain and pass in a language of our choice.

```typescript
const response = await chain.invoke(
    { messages: [new HumanMessage("hi! I'm bob")], language: "Spanish" }
)

console.log(response.content)
```

```
"¡Hola, Bob! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?"
```

Let's now wrap this more complicated chain in a Message History class. This time, because there are multiple keys in the input, we need to specify the correct key to use to save the chat history.

```typescript
const withMessageHistory = new RunnableWithMessageHistory({
    runnable: chain,
    getMessageHistory,
    inputMessagesKey: "messages",
})

const config = { configurable: { sessionId: "abc11" } }

const response = await withMessageHistory.invoke(
    { messages: [new HumanMessage("hi! I'm todd")], language: "Spanish" },
    config,
)

console.log(response.content)
```

```
¡Hola Todd! ¿En qué puedo ayudarte hoy?
```

```typescript
const response = await withMessageHistory.invoke(
  { messages: [new HumanMessage("Whats my name?")], language: "Spanish" },
  config,
)

console.log(response.content)
```

```
Tu nombre es Todd.
```
